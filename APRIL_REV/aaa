Computation is a central component of cancer genomics
research. Tumor sequencing is the basis of computational
investigation of mutational, epigenetic and immunologic
processes associated with cancer initiation and progression.
Numerous computational workflows have been produced to
profile tumor cell transcriptomes and proteomes.
New technologies promise to unite sequence-based
characterizations with digital histopathology,
ultimately driving efforts in molecule design
and evaluation to produce patient-centered treatments.

Bioconductor is an open source software project with
a 20 year history of uniting biostatisticians, bioinformaticians,
and genome researchers in the creation of an ecosystem
of data, annotation, and analysis resources for research
in genome-scale biology. This paper will review current
approaches of the project to advancing cancer genomics.
After a brief discussion of basic principles of the Bioconductor
project, we will present a ``top down'' survey of resources
useful for cancer bioinformatics. Primary sections address

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  how to explore institutionally curated cancer genomics data
\item
  genomic annotation resources relevant to cancer genomics
\item
  analytical workflows
\item
  components for introducing new data or analyses
\item
  pedagogics and workforce development.
\end{itemize}
