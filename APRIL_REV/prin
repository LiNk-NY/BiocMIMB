\hypertarget{r-packages-and-vignettes}{%
\subsection{R packages and vignettes}\label{r-packages-and-vignettes}}

Software tools and data resources in Bioconductor are organized
into ``R packages''. These are collections of folders with data,
code (principally R functions), and documentation
following a protocol specified in
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html}{Writing R Extensions}. R packages have a DESCRIPTION file with metadata about
package contents and provenance. Package structure can be
checked for validity using the \texttt{R CMD check} facility.
Documentation of code and data can be programmatically
checked for existence and validity. The DESCRIPTION file
for a package specifies its version and
also gives precise definition of how an R package may
depend upon versions of other packages.

At its inception,
Bioconductor introduced a new approach to holistic package
documentation called ``vignette''.
Vignettes provide narrative and explanation interleaved with
executable code describing package operations.
While R function manual pages describe
the operation of individual functions,
vignettes illustrate the interoperation
of package components and provide motivation
for both package design but also context
for its use.

\hypertarget{r-package-repositories-repository-evolution}{%
\subsection{R package repositories; repository evolution}\label{r-package-repositories-repository-evolution}}

Bioconductor software forms a coherent ecosystem that
can be checked for consistency of versions of all
packages available in a given installation of R.
Bioconductor packages may specify dependency on
other Bioconductor packages, or packages that are
available in the CRAN repository. Bioconductor does
not include packages with dependencies on ``github-only''
packages. Later in this paper we will provide details
on package quality assurance that provide a rationale
for this restriction.

Major updates to the R language occur annually, and
updates are preceded by careful assessment of effects of
language change on Bioconductor package operations. These effects
can be identified through changes in the output of R CMD check.
The Bioconductor ecosystem is updated twice a year, once
to coincide with update to R, and once about six months
later. The semianual updates reflect the need to track
developments in the fast-moving field of genomic data science.

\hypertarget{package-quality-assessment-installation-consistency}{%
\subsection{Package quality assessment; installation consistency}\label{package-quality-assessment-installation-consistency}}

The BiocCheck function is used to provide more
stringent assessment of package compliance with basic
principles of the Bioconductor ecosystem.

The BiocManager package provides for installing and updating package
and has functionality for verifying the coherence and version status
of the currently installed package collection.
This is important
in the context of a language and package ecosystem
that changes every six months, while analyses may
take years to complete. Tools for recreating past
package collections are available to assist in
reproducing outputs of prior analyses.

\hypertarget{unifying-assay-and-sample-data-summarizedexperiment-and-multiassayexperiment}{%
\subsection{Unifying assay and sample data: SummarizedExperiment and MultiAssayExperiment}\label{unifying-assay-and-sample-data-summarizedexperiment-and-multiassayexperiment}}

Most of the data from genome-scale experiments to be discussed
in this chapter are organized in special data containers
rooted in the concepts of the SummarizedExperiment class.
Briefly, assay data are thought of as occupying a \(G \times N\)
array, and sample level data occupy an \(N \times K\) table. The array
and the table are linked together in the SummarizedExperiment; see Figure \ref{fig:sesc}.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Multiple representations of assay results may be managed in this
structure, but all assay arrays must have dimensions \(G \times N\).

For experiment collections in which the same samples are subjected
to multiple genome-scale assays, MultiAssayExperiment containers are used. See Figure \ref{fig:masc} for the layout.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth,]{MAEschema} \caption{MultiAssayExperiment schematic.}\label{fig:masc}
\end{figure}

Further details on these data structures will be provided in section \ref{class}.

\hypertarget{cache}{%
\subsection{Downloading and caching cancer genomics data and annotations}\label{cache}}

Downloading and managing data from various online resources
can be excessively time consuming. Bioconductor encourages data caching for
increased efficiency and reproducibility. The caching data methods
employed in Bioconductor
allow analysis code to
concisely refer to data resources as needed, with minimal attention to how
data are stored, retrieved or transformed.
It allows for easy management and reuse of data that are on remote
servers or in cloud, storing source
location and providing information for data updates. The BiocFileCache
Bioconductor package handles data management from within R.

BiocFileCache is a general-use caching system but Bioconductor also provides
``Hubs'', AnnotationHub and ExperimentHub, to help distributed annotation or
experimental data hosted externally. Both AnnotationHub and ExperimentHub use
BiocFileCache to handle download and caching of data.

AnnotationHub provides a centralized repository of diverse genomic annotations,
facilitating easy access and integration into analyses. Researchers can
seamlessly retrieve information such as genomic features, functional
annotations, and variant data, streamlining the annotation process for their
analyses.

ExperimentHub extends this concept to experimental data. It serves as a
centralized hub for storing and sharing curated experiment-level datasets,
allowing researchers to access a wide range of experimental designs and
conditions. This cloud-based infrastructure enhances collaboration and promotes
the reproducibility of analyses across different laboratories.

The curatedTCGAData package provides some resources through
ExperimentHub, as do many other self-identified ``CancerData'' resources. Once the
ExperimentHub is loaded, it can be queried for terms of interest.

\texttt{\{r useeh\} \textless{}!-\/- , fig.cap="ExperimentHub attachment, retrieval, query, and response when seeking cancer-related data.", message=FALSE\} -\/-\textgreater{} library(ExperimentHub) eh \textless{}- ExperimentHub() query(eh, "CancerData")}

Multiple terms can be used to narrow results before choosing a download.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{query}\NormalTok{(eh, }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"cancerData"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"esophageal"}\NormalTok{))}
\CommentTok{\#\# ExperimentHub with 2 records}
\CommentTok{\#\# \# snapshotDate(): 2023{-}10{-}24}
\CommentTok{\#\# \# $dataprovider: University of California San Francisco}
\CommentTok{\#\# \# $species: Homo sapiens}
\CommentTok{\#\# \# $rdataclass: RangedSummarizedExperiment, data.frame}
\CommentTok{\#\# \# additional mcols(): taxonomyid, genome, description,}
\CommentTok{\#\# \#   coordinate\_1\_based, maintainer, rdatadateadded, preparerclass, tags,}
\CommentTok{\#\# \#   rdatapath, sourceurl, sourcetype }
\CommentTok{\#\# \# retrieve records with, e.g., \textquotesingle{}object[["EH8527"]]\textquotesingle{} }
\CommentTok{\#\# }
\CommentTok{\#\#            title                           }
\CommentTok{\#\#   EH8527 | cao\_esophageal\_wgbs\_hg19        }
\CommentTok{\#\#   EH8530 | cao\_esophageal\_transcript\_counts}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Similarly AnnotationHub files can be downloaded for annotating data. For example,
the ensembl 110 release of gene and protein annotations are obtained with the
following:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(AnnotationHub)}
\NormalTok{ah \textless{}{-}}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{AnnotationHub}\NormalTok{()}
\NormalTok{tag =}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{names}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{query}\NormalTok{(ah, }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Ensembl"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"110"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Homo sapiens"}\NormalTok{)))}
\NormalTok{ens110 \textless{}{-}}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{ah[[tag]]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
